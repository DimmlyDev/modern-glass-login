## 📂 Project Structure

I have organized the files into two versions for better accessibility and integration:

* **`dark-index.html`**: The complete standalone page for the **Dark Mode** version (Midnight Blue).
* **`light-index.html`**: The complete standalone page for the **Light Mode** version (Crystal White).
* **`dark-login-snippet.html`**: Only the essential HTML/CSS code for the dark card, perfect for copying into existing projects.
* **`light-login-snippet.html`**: Only the essential HTML/CSS code for the light card.

## ✨ Features
* **Frosted Glass Effect:** High-quality UI using `backdrop-filter`.
* **Responsive Design:** Works perfectly on mobile and desktop.
* **Floating Labels:** Interactive input fields with smooth transitions.
* **Developer Friendly:** Prefixed classes (`mg-`) to avoid CSS style conflicts.

## 🚀 How to Use
1. Choose your preferred theme (Dark or Light).
2. Open the corresponding `index.html` to see the full layout.
3. If you want to use it in your own site, use the code inside the `-snippet.html` files.
